## About
When selling products online, having good photos are crucial. But, for a small business, whoâ€™s just getting started, most of them do not have the means to hire professionals. A lot of them rely on their phones and their limited skills.

Pick-a-pick can help them take better photos by providing **guidance to understand better lighting and angle** as well as a **better way to organize those photos**.

## What I Did
On this challenge, I took on a more managerial role, and this was my first experience with this position. I was pretty heavily involved with the whole process from the start to finish. I think as a project manager, beyond making sure of the timeline and keeping everyone on track, our main role is trying to bridge between idea, design and the technical feasibility. If i can summarize what I learned and did was :

### Backlog Management
I created a project board and break down our tasks according each feature. This is where design and tech skills are needed for a PM. A PM needs to know both sides so they can break down the 'cards'. In each card, I tried to explain the design a bit further by using use-cases that sounds and looks like a pseudocode. In my experience, using this helps the programmer to note down the possible cases, that makes it easier them to understand the logic & flow. Using use-cases also helps to re-check whether a card is finished or not. Furthermore, if an app and team gets bigger and there is a dedicated QA, it will make it easy for the QA to check whether the requirements has already been satisfied.

### Maintain Repository
As a PM, maintaining the repository is essential. Since my team uses discord to communicate, and discord can be integrated with github, I added a webhook to a specific channel to help keep track of the work. So anytime someone pushes a branch or make a pull request, I will be immediately notified so I can check on the work. After I merged a pull request the team member will immediately be notified as well.

### Help the Team
Since some people in the team aren't familiar with Git yet, a PM's role is to help them understand better. So in my case, it was Git. I tried to help them by creating a presentation that will help them understand it a bit more.

## Technical
Since I was more heavily involved in management side, on the technical side I was able to explore about ARKit in making the reference point.

### Reference Point with ARKit
Since I was more heavily involved in management side, on the technical side I was able to explore about ARKit in making the reference point.

### Local Storage with CoreData
Besides AR, since our app is heavily reliant on data I also learned more about CoreData basic and CRUD.
