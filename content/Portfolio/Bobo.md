## About
Bobo is an app that helps busy parents stay in touch with their children through voice recording, paired with visual illustrations that can create a compelling audiovisual bedtime story experience for the child.

## Design
Initially, I thought I had to create an iPhone app, so my wireframe and lo-fi prototype were all made for iPhone. But then, when we had a peer feedback session, a friend suggests that apps for kids are better suited for iPad. I realized that they were right, and I immediately changed everything.

Since I came from a tech background with little knowledge of design, this part was challenging since it was my first time designing for a larger format and picking out everything alone. I decided to go with a dark purple-pinkish color since it gives the dreamy vibes I was going for. I also drew some of the ‘illustrations’ you see here. I can’t draw, but hey, I tried~

I drew the illustrations with Procreate on iPad, using 'chalky' 'crayon-ish' type of brush to get that child-like vibe.
