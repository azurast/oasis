title: Welcome to Thought Oasis
---

Salaam everyone! ðŸ‘‹  Welcome to my [digital garden](https://maggieappleton.com/garden-history), or perhaps more aptly, my oasis.

The idea of learning in public can be daunting, but the digital garden ethos embraces imperfection. Here, we cultivate knowledge together, flaws and all. Just like an oasis that begins with a single drop, our gardens grow over time.

My primary focus is software development, particularly **iOS development**, which I'm actively learning and exploring. Feel free to check out my [[Portfolio]]!

In my free time, I delve into **Islamic knowledge**, hoping my notes prove beneficial to others. I'm still on this learning journey myself, so please forgive any errors or inaccuracies.

I write in both English & Bahasa Indonesia, sometimes even blending the two. If that creates occasional confusion, I apologize in advance!
