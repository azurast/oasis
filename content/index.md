title: Welcome to Thought Oasis
---

Salaam everyone! ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to my [digital garden](https://maggieappleton.com/garden-history), or perhaps more aptly, my oasis. 

This is my third/fourth iteration attempt at a personal site over the years, but I can never put my finger on why I feel like it just never worked. Then after reading the above article on digital garden, I realized that I always aimed for perfection on my previous sites, because I thought it *had to* be perfect. In the end, I never consistently wrote the things I wanted to publish.

The idea of [learning in public](https://www.swyx.io/learn-in-public) can be daunting, but this digital garden ethos embraces imperfection. Here, I try to cultivate knowledge together, flaws and all. Just like an oasis that begins with a single drop, that grow over time.

My primary focus is software development, particularly **iOS development**, which I'm actively learning and exploring. Feel free to check out my [[Portfolio]]!

In my free time, I delve into **Islamic knowledge**, hoping my notes prove beneficial to others. I'm still on this learning journey myself, so please forgive any errors or inaccuracies. Please don't hesitate to <a href="mailto:azstima+thoughtoasis@gmail.com">contact me</a> if you find any errors regarding the notes I take.

I write in both English & Bahasa Indonesia, sometimes even blending the two. If that creates occasional confusion, I apologize in advance!
