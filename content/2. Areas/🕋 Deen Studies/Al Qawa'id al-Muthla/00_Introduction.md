## What is this book about?

The book will talk about principles in relates to Allah's names and attributes.  
If you want to know the virtue of a certain knowledge, take a look at the virtue of what being studied.
Why is this knowledge so important? We can say that this knowledge is the reason we are created. 
1. ****QS Az-Zariat**** → to worship Him
    You can't worship something that you don't know.
2. ****QS At-Talaq**** → to know Him 
3. ****QS Al-Mulk**** → to be tested by Him 
Which is a part of :
1. ****At Tawheed ul Ilm**** / The Tawheed of Knowledge / The Tawheed of Knowing and Affirming
2. ****The Tawheed al Aml**** / The Tawheed of Intention of Seeking Out / Tawheed al Uloohiyah 
    All the actions we do is for Allah. 
---
If you truly know Allah, you will be compelled to worship Him. 
You will be tested as how well you worship Him. 
Knowing Allah is not a theoritical science. It necessitates you to have an act of servitude towards Allah. Every single thing that you learn about Allah has a specific act of worship that comes out of it.

> [!Example]
> Knowing Allah has an attribute of As-Sami (The All Hearing), thus you become more careful with everything that you say. Or it could be that you will call out to Allah anytime anywhere because He is near and will hear you.

Whoever knows Allah more will worship Allah more, and disobey Him less.
The more knowledge you have of Allah, the more you will have fear (fear based on knowledge) of Him. 

## Why this topic is important
Learning this topic in the right way, can have a great beneficial in one's imaan. 
Mistakes in this topic is not like mistakes in other topics. 
Mistakes in aqeedah is very serious. Why?
1. **QS Fussilat : 22-23**

    > *"And you were not covering [i.e., protecting] yourselves, lest your hearing testify against you or your sight or your skins, but you assumed that Allah does not know much of what you do. And that was **your assumption which you assumed about your Lord. It has brought you to ruin**, and you have become among the losers."*
    
    It ruined them and they became the people of the fire

    <aside>

    ⏪ **Recall Aqeedatul Wasitiyah** 

    Our beliefs in Allah's names and attributes stands in 2 foundation :

    - What Allah affirms for Himself

    - What Allah negates about Himself

    </aside>

2. *QS Maryam : 88 - 93**
    > *"And they say, "**The Most Merciful has taken [for Himself] a son**." You have done an atrocious thing. The heavens almost rupture therefrom and the earth splits open and the mountains collapse in devastation. That they attribute to the Most Merciful a son. And it is not appropriate for the Most Merciful that He should take a son. There is no one in the heavens and earth but that he comes to the Most Merciful as a servant."*
    What happened here? they added an attribute to Allah, that Allah didn't create for Himself.  

    This is one of the greatest objective of the shaytaan. 
## Why is the principles important
They are like a foundation that you are building upon. The author is a great example of this. No matter how hard the issue or topic is, he always have a foundational principles to go back to. 
****On Qaidah****
- A comprhensive ruling by which many supplementary rulings are known, and from it rulings can be taken.
- A comprehensive ruling which can be applied to many smaller rulings.
- It applies to everything.
- Must be remembered along with the evidences.
- Principles also help to remove syubhat. But in order for that to be beneficial, has to be accompanied along with the daleels. A principle will never have only 1 evidence.
- Principles come from ****Al Istiqra**** (from the word Qiraah) which means a comprehensive, detailed reading & classification in order to reach ****Haqiqatuh Syariyah**** (A religious reality/truth).
> [!Example]
> along came a group of Khawarij, and they say "We don't accept your qaidah about Tawheed being 3" we say "Okay bring us what you have?" and they said "The fourth category of Tawheed is Allah's right to rule", the Ahlussunnah do not doubt that at all, but we do not agree that it is a separate category, it is part of Tawheed Al-Ruboobiyyah & Tawheed Al-Uloohiyah (we are required to follow by what Allah have revealed).
- People can come up with something but we have to ask for the daleel & match it with the ways of the salafs. To ensure they just don't make things up for their own agenda.
- This is what you can see in ahlul bid'ah. They create a ruling first, and then find a supporting evidence for it. Whilst ahlusunnah would extract rulings based on evidences.
****On The Author****
- The sheikh was born in 1347H & passed away in 2001 Gregorian year. He was very precise in speaking.
****On Al-Muthla****
- al-Muthla means exemplary or the best way of doing something.
- This word is mentioned in the Qur'an in ****QS. Taha : 63****
    > They concluded, “These two are only magicians who want to drive you out of your land with their magic, and do away with **your most cherished** traditions.
- It is the feminine form of Al-Amtsal which means ****the best way****

****On the Book****
- Together with the word Qawaid → Al-Qawa'id al-Muthla it measn ****the examplary principles****.
- The full name of the book is : Al-Qawa'id al-Muthla fii Sifatin' Ta Ala was Asmai Husna which translates to : "The Exemplary Principles Regarding Allah's Attributes and His Beautiful Names"
- Why does the shaikh mentions Allah's attributes first? No particular reason.
- The book is divided into three parts :
    1. The Principles Regarding Allah's Names
    2. The Principles Regarding Allah's Attributes
    3. Evidences for the previous topics

- ****What is the difference between a name and an attribute?****

    - A name is something that gives us 2 things, and attributes only gives us 1.

    - A name indicates :

        - The name of Allah by which Allah is known. Something we can call Allah by.

        - There is an attribute or attributes that is connected to that name.

    - An attribute only gives us that one attribute for Allah Subhana wa taala.

        <aside>

        🔍 **Example** : *"Allah loves the people who repent, and Allah loves those who purify themseleves."* from this we know that Allah has an attribute of loving, but there are no names that is associated with this attribute.
