### Elaboration

  

- ****What does 'husna' mean?****

    That they reach the pinnacle of al-husna. Roughly translates as perfectly beautiful. It originated from the word hasan & hasna (beautiful in arabic). Here it referes to the absolute pinnacle of complete and total perfection & beauty for all of Allah's names.

- When the sheikh mentions that Allah's names are at the pinnacle, he ****doesn't mean that there is a limit****. What the sheikh means is an absolute or unlimited perfection.

- ****What makes these names perfect?****

    Because these names encompass perfect attributes.

    What makes these names perfect are not just titles, they are real as they have attributes.

    The attributes are perfect.

    There are no deficiencies in Allah's names in any way.

- ****3 ways a name can be deficient :****

    1. ****A deficient name****

        <aside>

        🔍 **Example** : is Allah's name al-shar (the evil)? No, because all of Allah's names are husna whilst this name is not.

        </aside>

    2. ****There are some names which have possibilities of good & bad meaning (ambiguous)****

        <aside>

        🔍 **Example** : is Allah's name al-makir (the one who plots)? no, because it is possible to have bad connotations.

        </aside>

        Something that has a possibility of being good and bad cannot be called husna.

    3. ****The deficiency is related to something conencted to the name**** 

        <aside>

        🔍 **Example** : we know that Allah speaks, but do we say that Allah (al-mutatakallun) is the speaker? no because it depends on what you are speaking about. Because one can speak about things that are good or things that are bad, thus, not reflecting the qaidah of husna.

        </aside>

        It's not the word itself, but what you do with the word that matters.

- ****4 categories of names****

    From the reasons stated above, we can group names into 4 categories

    1. Names that are perfectly beautiful (husna)

        Names ascribed to Allah are those that in and within themselves perfect and dont need any clarification to understand their perfection.

    2. Names that are deficient, ugly, weak, (the opposite of husna)

    3. Names that can be perfect and deficient (dual possibility)

    4. Names that needs something added to them to be perfect, other than that, they are not perfect.

- ****Benefits of the Qawaid****

    1. Helps you understand names that are ascribed to Allah and those that aren't.

    2. When you are talking to someone, you can bring the principles.

  

### ****Examples****

  

- ****Al-Hayy****, ****the Ever-Living****

    - An infinitely perfect life.

    - This living is encompassed within the name Al-Hayy.

    - How is Allah's life and livig unlike of His creations'?

        - ****This life was never precedded by nothingness.**** There was never a time when Allah did not exist. There was never a time when Allah was never a life.

        - ****Allah's living, life, will never cease****, and He has always been living.

    - This name itself, necessitates other names.

    - All of Allah's names that refers back to himself, they go back to Al-Hayy, and all of Allah's names that refers back to his creations, they go back to Al-Qayyun, the one who sustains his creations. Thus why both names have encompassed the all of Allah names. ****dilalat al nuzum.****

- ****Al Alim****, ****the All-Knowing****

    - Perfect knowledge

    - How is Allah's knowledge unlike of His creations'?

        - ****The knowledge was never preceeded with ignorance.****

        - ****The knowledge was never followed with forgetfulness.****

    - It is a knowledge that encompasses all things in general and in detail, whether it relates to His actions or the actions of His creatures.

    - ****QS Al-An'am 6:59****

- ****Ar Rahman, the Most Merciful****

    - Perfect mercy

        ![Screen Shot 2021-09-21 at 02.42.33.png](Screen_Shot_2021-09-21_at_02.42.33.png)

- The perfect beauty of each of Allah's names is found in the name individually or when a name is joined with another name, it is perfection upon perfection.
