> [!Hadith]
> On the authority of #AbdullahIbnUmar (ra):
> The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said, "I have been ordered to fight against the people until they testify that there is none worthy of worship except Allah and that Muhammad is the Messenger of Allah, and until they establish the salah and pay the zakat. And if they do that then they will have gained protection from me for their lives and property, unless [they commit acts that are punishable] in Islam, and their reckoning will be with Allah." [[Bukhari](https://sunnah.com/bukhari/2/18) & [Muslim](https://sunnah.com/muslim/1/36)]

Ibn Umar → the son of Umar, in this case Abdullah ibn Umar ibn Khattab.

أُمِرْتُ → I was commanded. This shows that the prophet is the slave of Allah.

This hadith has nothing to do with the the rulings of Jihad.
This does not mean you should kill non muslims.
This hadith is trying to explain to you what sanctity means in the sharia. The context of sanctity here is wealth & blood (life).

**When is your life & wealth protected?**
1.  When you enter Islam → shahadatein (the two shahadah)
2.  Stays as a muslim by doing the practices of a muslim

**3 Categories of Non Muslims**
1.  Al-Muharom → The ones you face with in a battlefield
2.  The ones you have treaty with
3.  Musta'man → The ones who are protected
    Example : Guest, a non muslim who came to a muslim country who holds a visa (contract)

**Things that will remove your sanctity :**
1.  Leaving off things that are fard (waajib)
2.  Done something haram
    Example : killing someone, when you go to trial your sanctity is gone, either you pay the price with your life or pay blood money.
