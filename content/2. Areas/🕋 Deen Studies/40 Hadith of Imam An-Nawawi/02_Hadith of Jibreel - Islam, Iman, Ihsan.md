> [!Hadith]
>  Also on the authority of #Umar (ra) who said:
>  While we were one day sitting with the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) there appeared before us a man dressed in extremely white clothes and with very black hair. No traces of journeying were visible on him, and none of us knew him. He sat down close by the Prophet (ﷺ) rested his knees against the knees of the Prophet (ﷺ) and placed his palms over his thighs, and said: "O Muhammad! Inform me about Islam." The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) replied: "Islam is that you should testify that there is no deity worthy of worship except Allah and that Muhammad is His Messenger (ﷺ), that you should perform salah (ritual prayer), pay the zakah, fast during Ramadan, and perform Hajj (pilgrimage) to the House (the Ka'bah at Makkah), if you can find a way to it (or find the means for making the journey to it)." He said: "You have spoken the truth." We were astonished at his thus questioning him (ﷺ) and then telling him that he was right, but he went on to say, "Inform me about Iman (faith)." He (the Prophet) answered, "It is that you believe in Allah and His angels and His Books and His Messengers and in the Last Day, and in fate (qadar), both in its good and in its evil aspects." He said, "You have spoken the truth." Then he (the man) said, "Inform me about Ihsan." He (the Prophet) answered, "It is that you should serve Allah as though you could see Him, for though you cannot see Him yet He sees you." He said, "Inform me about the Hour." He (the Prophet) said, "About that the one questioned knows no more than the questioner." So he said, "Well, inform me about its signs." He said, "They are that the slave-girl will give birth to her mistress and that you will see the barefooted ones, the naked, the destitute, the herdsmen of the sheep (competing with each other) in raising lofty buildings." Thereupon the man went off. I waited a while, and then he (the Prophet) said, "O 'Umar, do you know who that questioner was?" I replied, "Allah and His Messenger know better." He said, "That was Jibril. He came to teach you your religion." [[Muslim](https://sunnah.com/muslim/1/1)]

-   The man knew who the Prophet Salallahualaihiwassalam was. It is **considered strange** because the companions do look like him in terms of appearance, the prophet sat with them & sat with them.
-   The scholars differ as to whose knees the man put his hands on.
-   We take the opinion that says the man puts his hands on the prophet's knees.
-   This action emphasizes that he wants an answer (Arab customs).
-   Another strange thing is that this man called out the prophet's name
-   This incident happened before the ayah regarding the order to not call the prophet by his name directly (Surah Noor: 63-64) came down.
-   Later on, it was revealed that **this man was Angel Jibreel AS** who came to teach the prophet about the verses of Allah as a bedouin man.
-   3 forms in which #Jibreel came:
    1.  True angel form
    2.  Sahabi/Companion known as Dishy Al Kalbee)
    3.  A Bedouin man
## What is #Islam?
### The definition of Islam (is divided into 3 parts) :
 1.  **االأِسْتِسْلامُ لِلَّهِ بِالتّوحيدد**
    **Al istislamu lillahi bit tauhid :** To submit to Allah with #tawheed. Submit to Allah completely, not submitting to anyone else including your own desires. ^3e6676
 2. **والأنقياد له بالطاعة**
    **Wal inqiyaadu lahu bit too’ah** : To follow it up with acts of #obedience. It is not sufficient for you to say you're a muslim and lay around sleeping all day without doing any acts of obedience.
3. **و البراءة من الشرك و أهل**
    **Wal barooatu minasyirki wa ahlih**: To free yourself from #shirk & the people of shirk (in your **heart** (hate the shirk) & the people of shirk (for what they have in them), in your **tongue** by testifying that you are free from this & that you worship Allah alone, in your **limbs** by leaving the time when the people of shirk is worshipping their false deities, stay away from their temples & their holidays/festivals).
If you find yourself lacking in one of these three things then you are not Muslim by definition.
### The 5 Pillars of Islam :
We must **be specific** when we mention the 5 pillars.
1. #Testify that there is no deity of worship except Allah and that Muhammad is His Messenger. ^f053ce
2. The establishment of #salah on a specific time, in a specific manner.
3. To give #zakah in a specific time, with specific amount, to a specific group of people.
4. To #fast on the month of Ramadhan.
5. To perform #Hajj to the House of Allah (Ka'aba) in a specific pattern & manner if able.
^2b83c6
> [!NOTE]
> **Why is hajj not compulsory for those who are not able?** 
> Because hajj is comprised of both physical & financial acts of ibadah, that is why Allah has not made it compulsory for those who are unable to perform hajj out of mercy.
#### Breakdown of the Shahadah
![[02_Hadith of Jibreel - Islam, Iman, Ihsan#^f053ce]]
-   There is no deity → Negation / #Nafi (La illlaha)
-   Except Allah → Affirmation / #Isbat (Illallah)
-   Muhammad is His Messenger encompasses :
	1.  To obey the prophet in what he has commanded you to do (because he conveys the message of Allah)
	2.  To affirm it is true what he has informed us.
	3.  To stay away from the things he told us to stay away from & from the things he prohibits.
	4.  To worship Allah in accordance with the prophet's way. 
This man already knew the answer. From this, we benefit that you can ask a person of knowledge the question you already know the answer to.
## What is #Iman?
-   Lugathan (language)
-   Syaran (sharia)
-   In the arabic language, Al-Iman means Al-Ikram, to establish, to become stable, to verify, to hold something true in your heart, to testify.
-   In the sharia, there is a specific definition
### The definition of Iman (5 parts) According to ahlusunnah wal jamaah :
1.  **Qawulun bil lisaan** (speech on the #tongue), ex: dzikir, reciting Qur'an
2.  **Atiqadun bil qalb** (belief in your #heart)
3.  **Amalul al jarikh** (limb) **wal al arkan** (heart) (the actions of the #limbs & the heart)
4.  **yazidu bit taat** (increases with acts of #obedience)
5.  **Yan kusu bil maksiat** (decereases with acts of #disobedience)
### The 6 Pillars of Iman :
#### 1.**To believe in #Allah**
When you say you have iman in Allah (amantu billah), you are saying 4 things :
1. **Believe that Allah exists**. 
   The general evidences that Allah exists are 4 :
   1. **Al-Akl**: Analyses with your intellect. We see Allah h2as created the world, these creations were created by their creator. Every leaf, every ocean, ever.
   2. **Al-Hiss**: Anything you can asses with your senses (tangible evidences). Ex. when we make dua & see it being answered right before your eyes. Story of the prophet making dua for rain when it was a sunny day, the story of the three people stuck in the cave.
   3. **Al-Fitrah**: Innate disposition/nature of a person. Every single person is born upon fitrah.
   4. **As-Shar'ah**: The shariah, the qur'an and the sunnah. Ibn Qayyim said every single ayah in the Quran is an evidence of the tawheed of Allah.
2.  **Believe in the #Tawheed of ar-roobobiyah (the lordship of Allah)**
	We single out Allah in 3 things :
	1.  **Al-Khalq** : Allah is the only creator of everything
	2.  **Al-Mulk** : Allah is the king & the owner of everything
	3.  **Tadbir** : Allah is the controller of all affairs
3.  **Believe in the tawheed of al-uloohiyah (the worship of Allah)**
	We single out Allah in our worship → To worship to and for Allah alone
4.  **Believe in the tawheed of asma was sifat (the names & attributes of Allah)**
	To believe in singling out of Allah's name and attributes
	ex: Ar-Rahman is the name of Allah,
	this name has the attribute of Rahmah
	affirm both for Allah
#### 2. To believe in the #angels
1.  They are unseen creators of Allah, and is only shown to specific people (the nabis & rasuls)
2.  Allah created the angel from light
3.  They obey Allah and they do not disobey Allah
4.  They have ruh (evidence: ruh al quds (jibreel)
5.  They have bodies (they have wings)
6.  They have intellect & hearts ("..when fear strikes into their hearts")
7.  They have specific names but we only know some(mikail, jibreel, israfil, etc)
#### 3. To believe in His books #quran
1.  Believe that they are the speech of Allah
2.  These were sent down but not created
3.  Sent a book with every messenger
4.  The Qur'an abrogates everything that came before it
5.  Affirms the names of the books & the books we do not know the names of
#### 4. To believe in His #messengers
1.  Believe that they are human beings just like us
2.  Believe that they are the slaves of Allah, and we do not worship them
3.  Allah sent down wahyu to them
4.  Allah gave them miracles (mukjizat)
5.  Believe that they convey the message of Allah
6.  Believe in their names & the ones we do not know the names of
7.  A prophet (nabi) is a person who did not come with a new sharia while a messenger (rasul) came with a new sharia. A messenger is a prophet but a prophet may/may not be a messenger.
	1.  The first prophet of Allah is Adam A.S
	2.  The first messenger of Allah is Nuh A.S
	3.  The last prophet & messenger of Allah is Muhammas salallahualaihiwassalam
	4.  The ulul azmi minal rusul (the 5 chosen to be the greatest than the rest), in order;
		1.  Muhammad salallahualaihiwassalam
		2.  Nuh alaihissalam
		3.  Ibraheem alaihissalam
		4.  Musa alaihissalam
		5.  Isa alaihissaalam
#### 5. To believe in the #lastday
Kullu mankana ba'dal maut
Believe in everything that comes after death
#### 6. To believe in the pre-ordained destiny of Allah in the good & the bad #Qadr
To believe that Allah has knowledge of everything
1.  **Al-Ilm**, What is going to happen, and if it were going to happen, how it is going to happen.
2.  **Al-Kitabah**, Allah has written everything down of everything that is going to happen form the beginning till the end of time.
3.  **Al-Masiah**, Allah has will. You cannot do anything except if Allah wills for it to happen.
	→ this doesn't mean that you dont have free will, rather, whatever you choose, Allah already knows, and he wills for it to happen.
4.  **Al-Khalq**, Allah created everything & our actions are also created.
## What is #Ihsan?
### The definition of Ihsan (2 parts)
1.  **Worship Allah as if you can see him** → worship out of love & desire for what he has in store for you in #Jannah. (Ibadah Al-Mushahadah)
2.  If you can't, **worship Allah like he is watching over you** → worship Allah out of fear of Him & His punishment #Jahannam. (Ibadah Al-Muroqabah)
## The Hour
1.  The only one who knows about #thehour is Allah alone
2.  The prophet gave 2 signs out of the many
    **The slave-girl will give birth to her mistress** has 2 interpretation
    1.  Children will disobey parents so much as if the mother is their slave
    2.  The slave will give birth to her master's son (free man)
    **you will see the barefooted ones, the naked, the destitute, the herdsmen of the sheep (competing with each other) in raising lofty buildings**
    The 'bedouins' will compete in building tall towers, when they used to be shepherds
