**About the Narrator**
-   Aisha R.A, was given the title Ummul Mu'minin (Mother of the believers)
-   Ummi Abdullah is a kunyah, this does not refer to her son, rather it is for her nephew, Abdullah ibn Zubair, the son of her sister, Asma. She loves her nephew so much that she's called Umm Abdullah.

> [!Hadith]
> On the authority of the mother of the faithful, #Aisha (ra), who said:
> The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said, “He who innovates something in this matter of ours (i.e., Islam) that is not of it will have it rejected (by Allah).” [[Bukhari](https://sunnah.com/bukhari/53/7) & [Muslim](https://sunnah.com/muslim/30/23)] In another version in [Muslim](https://sunnah.com/muslim/30/24) it reads: “He who does an act which we have not commanded, will have it rejected (by Allah).”

In another version in **Muslim** it reads: _“He who does an act which we have not commanded, will have it rejected (by Allah).”_

This hadith is comprised of 2 things
## The ruling (ta'rif) of doing #bidah
### 4 part definition of bid'ah
1. **Ihdats** (to innovate) : to bring something new that was not there previously.
2. **Fi amrina** (in matters of our religion) : anything regarding the deen, not matters of the dunya like cars, telephones, etc.
3. **Not of it** : does not go back to the foundation/principles of our religion.
   Doing it with the **intention of worship** (i.e to get closer to Allah)
4. **The hukum**
	-   It will not be accepted
	-   **Principle** : anything that is not accepted by Allah is haraam.
	-   Bid'ah is the second greatest evil after shirk.

Anything that is not commanded & is opposing the sharia (is included in the 2nd definition of bid'ah since it is matters regarding the sharia) is also rejected.
#IbnMasud summarized this in his statement :
> _"Follow (the commands you have been commanded to do) and do not innovate. You have been sufficed."_
What is given by the prophet is already sufficient. You don't need to look anywhere else.
-   This is why **any act of worship in #Islam has 2 pillars**
    1.  Coming with sincerity #ikhlas, evidence : the first hadith of this book
    2.  In accordance of what the prophet has taught #mutabaat, evidence : this hadith.
