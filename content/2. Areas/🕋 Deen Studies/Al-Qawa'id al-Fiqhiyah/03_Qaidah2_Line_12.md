# **Definition**

> The religion is build upn benefits

Maslahah (Benefits) :

-   Considered, ex: Hajj
-   Not Considered, ex: Buying and selling of alcohol
-   Shariah stayed silent (Mursalat), ex: Traffic signs

Some scholars (Ibn Qayyim & Ibn Taymiyyah) takes the opinion that the third Maslahah does not exist, only the first 2.

When you have 2 benefits but you are limited with time, you give preceedence to the one that has a higher benefit.

Examples

-   Reciting quran in the masjid, and a janazah came in, thus you have the option to pray janazah. If you have the ability to do both, then do both.
-   How to choose the higher benefits? The one that aligns with the things the sharia protects.

5 things the Sharia Protects :

-   Ad-Deen, your religion
-   An-Nafs, your life
-   your lineage
-   Al-Akl, your intellect
-   Al-Mal, your wealth

Some scholars says there are a 6th one

# How to Choose?

1.  **Benefit that exceeds yourself is better than benefits that is restricted to yourself (general over specific maslahah)**
    
    -   In the masjid you have 2 options : seeking knowledge vs sit and recite the Qur'an. You choose the first because the benefits are more likely to go beyond yourself. Imam Ahmad even said "Between ibadan in the night vs warning people off innovations, I would choose to warn people off innovation."
2.  **When you are faced with something that is obligatory and voluntary**
    
    -   You got the opportunity to pray at the Masjid. You came close to the start of the congregation prayer, it can start anytime soon. You have the option to pray the sunnah prayer but you might miss the start of congregation prayer. In this case, pick the obligatory prayer.
    -   Seek knowledge or tend to your parents. It depends but generally choose your parents. For example if you are seeking voluntary knowledge (additions)
3.  **When faced with 2 obligations, choose the one that is more wajib.**
    
    -   On nafkah, it becomes wajib :
        
        -   Marriage (Az-Zaujiah)
        -   Ownership
        -   Family Members
        
        Let's say you're in a tight condition, who do you choose? The wife is important.
        
4.  When faced with rukun (pillar) vs wajib
    
    -   Fast in ramadhan vs you taking an oath to always fast on Mondays and Thurdays (thus it becomes wajib), choose the pillar because it is more wajib.
5.  When faced with 2 sunnah actions
    
6.  Like the first 1 but depends on specific place and time
