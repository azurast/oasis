<aside> üïã Narrated **Ibn Abbas** (May Allah be pleased with him) "Allah (Alone) is sufficient for us, and He is the Best Disposer of affairs (for us)," was said by Ibrahim (May Allah be pleased with him) when he was thrown into the fire; and it was said by Muhammad (May the peace and blessing of Allah be upon him) when they (i.e. hypocrites) said, "Verily the people (pagans) have gathered against you (a great army), therefore, fear them, but it only increased them in Faith". (Al-Bukhari and An-Nasa'i)

**2 Pillars of Putting Trust in Allah**

1.  **Make your heart rely on Allah subhanawataala**
    
    You put your trust in Allah that everything happens with His will.
    
    Believing that everything the Allah has decreed will be carried out.
    
2.  **Take the means by 'tying the camel'**
    
    Also you 'tie the camel', you do ikhtiar whilst putting your trust in Allah
    
    Take the means to make something come true
    
    <aside> üïã **Anas ibn Malik** reported: A man said, ‚ÄúO Messenger of Allah, should I tie my camel and trust in Allah, or should I leave her untied and trust in Allah?‚Äù The Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, said, ‚ÄúTie her and trust in Allah.‚Äù Source: Sunan al-TirmidhiÃÑ 2517 Grade: Hasan (fair) according to Al-Albani

    **Example :**
    
    -   You pray & rely on Allah for giving you a great spouse, but you also try and give your effort by attending marriage meetings.
    -   You pray to get a job but you put in the effort to send out your resumes and have interviews etc.

**2 Types Putting Trust in OTHER than Allah**

1.  **In which they have no ability for**
    
    **Example :** asking to the dead/grave
    
2.  **Putting your trust in other than Allah in that which is originally in the hands of Allah**
    
    Your heart becomes now connected to this person/ this thing. You are entrusting someone else. This is like a hidden shirk. You can know whether you are entrusting someone way too much is by your feeling once they disappoint you. If you feel sad then you put your trust in them too much.
    
    **Example :** Provisions. When someone entrusting they boss/government for example for provision up to the point until their heat is so engrossed with them.
