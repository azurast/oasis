    <aside> üïã **Abu Sa'id** (May Allah be pleased with him) narrated the following Marfu' Hadith: "It is the weakness of certainty (complete Faith) to seek pleasure of others by displeasing Allah and to praise others for the livelihood which was provided by Allah and to blame others for the thing not bestowed by Allah. Not even the greediness of the most greedy person can bring the livelihood of Allah, and not even anybody's aversion can prevent it." [Reported by Abu Nu'aim in Al-Hilyah].
