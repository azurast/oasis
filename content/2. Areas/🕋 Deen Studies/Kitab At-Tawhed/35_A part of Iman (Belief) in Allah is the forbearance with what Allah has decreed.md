> "And whosoever believes in Allah, He guides his heart [to the true Faith with certainty i.e. what has befallen him was already written for him by Allah from the Qadar (Divine Preordainment)] and Allah is the All-Knower of everything."

Whoever comes to Allah with a true iman, Allah will guide his heart. Often we say 'if you didnt do so and so, so and so wouldn't have happened.'

<aside> ðŸ•‹ **At- Tirmidhi** reported that the Prophet (May the peace and blessing of Allah be upon him) said: "The greatness of the reward is tied to the greatness of the trial. When Allah loves a people, He puts them to the trial. Whoever is acceptant of it will have Allah's acceptance and whoever is displeased and unacceptant with it will gain Allah's displeasure."

</aside>

Often we hear people say 'Why me? why so and so happened to me?'

When we are facing a calamity, which of the three is the cause?

1.  Because of your sins
2.  Because Allah loves you
3.  Because Allah wants to expiate your sins

The answer is we can't say witch certainty which of the three is the cause, but we increase the probability that it is because of our sins because it will take us to a better path. We repent. If it is because of our sins, then it (Insya Allah) will be forgiven, and if it's not, then you have nothing to lose. Your situation will get better.
