2 traits :

1.  People who **feel safe** from the punishment of Allah.
2.  People who **don't believe in the mercy of Allah**, they don't believe they can be forgiven, when we advice them they act like they don't have a care anymore in the world. Usually phrases like "I'm doomed" comes out of their mouths.

<aside> ðŸ•‹ Narrated **Ibn Abbas** (May Allah be pleased with him) Allah's Messenger (May the peace and blessing of Allah be upon him) was asked concerning **major sins** then he (May the peace and blessing of Allah be upon him) said, " (1) Associating others with Allah; (2) To lose hope of relief from Allah and (3) Thinking oneself secure from the Plan of Allah,"

In another narration : **Abdur-Razzaq reports from Ibn Mas'ud** (May Allah be pleased with him) that the Prophet (May the peace and blessing of Allah be upon him) said: The greatest of the major sins is Shirk -associating others with Allah, thinking oneself secure from the Plan of Allah, to despair of the Mercy of Allah, and lose hope of Allah's Relief" .
