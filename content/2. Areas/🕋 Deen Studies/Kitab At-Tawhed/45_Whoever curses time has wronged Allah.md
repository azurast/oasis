The latter part of the hadith explains it 'My hands are all things, and I cause the revolution of the day and the night' so, whatever you are insulting is Allah is saying He created it.

What Allah is saying when He says 'Iam Ad-Dahr (the time)' is 'I am the Creator'

**Scenarios**

2.  Insulting weather & time because of a bad thing that happened to you, sometimes it's not even the weather or time that causes the bad thing that happened to them. Remember that these things has no control whatsoever.
    
3.  Relating the severity of what is happening
    
    Ex: "today was a very tough day"
