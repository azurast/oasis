**Recall**

QS Ibraheem (14:35)

_And [mention, O Muhammad], when Abraham said, "My Lord, make this city [Makkah] secure and **keep me and my sons away from worshipping idols.**_

_**"What I fear most for you is a form of Shirk."** When asked about it, he said, **"Ar-Riya (showing off)."**_

_"Whoever dies while ascribing partners to Allah, enters the Hell-fire."_

_"Whoever meets Allah (on the Day of Judgement) not having associated anyone with Him (in worship), shall enter Paradise; and whoever meets Him having committed Shirk in any way will enter the Hell-fire."_

**Notes**

-   Nowadays we are normalizing kufr & minor shirk so much
    
-   He's speaking to THE COMPANIONS. The best generation of muslims.
    
-   What is meant by ascribing partners to Allah? To take what is exclusively is for Allah to somebody else.
    
-   Ex : asking someone to dua on behalf of you.
    
-   Just as salah is an act of worship, dua is an act of worship.
