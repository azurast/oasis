<aside> ðŸ•‹ **Abu Dawud** and other collectors : It is narrated from **Abu Shuraih** (May Allah be pleased with him) : His Kunyah (nickname) was Abul-Hakam. So the Prophet (May the peace and blessing of Allah be upon him) once said to him, "Allah is Al-Hakam (the Judge); and His Judgement is to prevail." Then Abu Shuraih said, "My people come to me for adjudication of their disputes; and when I judge between them, both parties are pleased with my judgement." The Prophet (May the peace and blessing of Allah be upon him) rejoined, "How excellent is this! Do you have any children?" I said, "Yes, Shuraih, Muslim and Abdullah." Then the Prophet (May the peace and blessing of Allah be upon him) asked, "Who is the eldest?" I said, "Shuraih," then the Prophet (May the peace and blessing of Allah be upon him) said, "You are henceforth to be called Abu Shuraih."

</aside>

Abu Shuraih has the kunyah 'Abul-Hakam' he was the person who everyone would refer back to regarding rulings/judging or solving their disputes.

It is better , more virtuous, more preferable that one refrains from calling oneself 'Abul-Hakam'. Why he said 'preferable' because 23 of the companions were called Hakm.

**Principle for naming / taking Allah's names and attributes** :

Look the meaning of the name

If within that name there is an attribute that is solely for Allah, then you should not use it. Ex : Al-Ahad

If you wish to name someone with Allah's attributes, preceed it with 'Abd' which will make the meaning to 'Slave of..' Ex : Abdurrahman, Abdullah, etc.
