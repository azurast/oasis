**Recall**

QS Yusuf (12:108)

Say you (O Muhammad (May the peace and blessing of Allah be upon him) : '**This is my way (1); I invite unto Allah (2)** (i.e. to the Oneness of Allah –Islamic Monotheism) (with sure **(3)** **knowledge**), I and whosoever follows me (also must invite others to Allah i.e. to the Oneness of Allah -Islamic Monotheism) with sure knowledge. And Glorified and Exalted is Allah (above all that they associate as partners with Him), and I am not of the polytheists.' "

The quraish said this about the prophet :

"Muhammad has caused split between the people (because of his call to tawheed)"

at the same time Allah said in the Qur'an :

"Hold on to the rope of Allah and do not disunite."

When Allah's Messenger (May the peace and blessing of Allah be upon him) sent Mu'adh (May Allah be pleased with him) to Yemen, he said, "You will come upon the People of theBook, **let your first act be to call them to testify that -There is nothing worthy of worship in truth but Allah."**

To single out Allah Alone in the worship, i.e. actualize the Oneness (Tauhid) of Allah-if they obey you in this, **inform them that Allah has prescribed for them to offer 5 prayers (Salat) every day and night.** If they obey you in this, then inform them that Allah has imposed upon them the duty of Sadaqah (Zakat) to be levied from their rich and distributed to the poor**,** If they obey you in this, then be careful not to take the best of their properties (as payment of Zakat), and **safeguard yourself against the supplication of those who have suffered injustice because there is no veil between his supplication and Allah,**"

"**Tomorrow I shall indeed give the flag to a person who loves Allah and His Messenger and is loved by Allah and His Messenger. Allah will grant victory under his leadership."** the people spent the night absorbed in discussing as to whom might the flag be given! In the morning they came eagerly to Allah's Messenger (May the peace and blessing of Allah be upon him) each of them hoping to be given the flag. Allah's Messenger (May the peace and blessing of Allah be upon him) asked "Where is Ali bin Abi Talib?" They replied, "He is suffering from an eye ailment." He was sent for and brought. Allah's Messenger (May the peace and blessing of Allah be upon him) then spat in his eyes and prayed for him, where upon he was cured as if he had no previous pains. **Allah's Messenger** (May the peace and blessing of Allah be upon him) **then gave him the flag and said**, **"Advance with ease and gentleness until you arrive in their midst, then call them to Islam and inform them of their duties to Allah in Islam. By Allah, if He may guide through you a single man to Islam then it is better for you than the red camels."**

**Notes**

-   At some point we will give dawah
-   The job dawah is the job of the prophet, so if we are going to it we must do it in their way.
-   **(1)** We are calling the way of the prophet salallahualaihiwassalam in accordance to his way.
-   **(2)** When giving dawah, we are calling to Allah, and thus it must comes with sincerity. We only want to please Allah and no one else.
-   **(3)** The dawah must be based upon knowledge.
-   Some people argue with the hadith "Convey from me even if just one ayah."
-   “Whoever attributes a statement to me of which I did not say, then let him find his seat in the Hellfire.”
-   "Whoever calls upon guidance, let that person take the reward of everyone who follows him."
-   But on the flip side :
-   "Whoever calls to misguidance, for him is the sin of everyone who follows him."
-   The rope of Allah is the siratul mutaqeen (the straight path)
-   Which path is the right path? The prophet's path.
-   The one who isn't on the straight path is the one disuniting the ummah.
    -   The first thing when someone does dawah is to call upon tawheed.
-   Salah is the bare minimum of this deen.
-   What makes the believer different from the unbelievers is salah.
-   If an individual accepts Islam, the true Islam in accordance to the prophet's way because of you, then it is better than the best possession in this world.
