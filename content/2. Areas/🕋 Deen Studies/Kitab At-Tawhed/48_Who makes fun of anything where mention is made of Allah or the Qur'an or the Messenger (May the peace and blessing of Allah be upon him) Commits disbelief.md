> â€œIf you ask them (about this), they declare: 'We were only talking idly and joking.' Say: 'Was it at Allah (May Allah be pleased with him) and His Ayat (proofs, evidences, verses, lessons, signs, revelations, etc.) and His Messenger (May the peace and blessing of Allah be upon him) that you were mocking? ' " (9:65)

<aside> ðŸ•‹ In the course of the campaign of battle Tabuk, a man carne up one day and declared: "We have seen no people with greater appetite, more lying, more cowardly in battle than those people," he meant Allah's Messenger (May the peace and blessing of Allah be upon him) and his Companions. Awf bin Malik rose and said, "In fact, you are the liar and a hypocrite (Mundfiq) and I will inform Allah's Messenger (May the peace and blessing of Allah be upon him) about your words." So he went to Allah's Messenger (May the peace and blessing of Allah be uponhim) but by then he (May the peace and blessing of Allah be upon him) was already informedthrough a revelation. Meanwhile, the hypocrite also approached Allah's Messenger (May the peace and blessing of Allah be upon him) when he (May the peace and blessing of Allah be uponhim) started journey and was already on his camel. He pleaded: **"O Messenger of Allah! we were only joking and trying to pass the time while traveling."** Ibn Umar (May Allah be pleased withhim) said, "As if I see him that he was clinging to the saddle belt of the Messenger of Allah's camel as it ran and his legs were being battered by the rough ground and even then he continuedpleading (i.e. we were only joking)." Allah's Messenger (May the peace and blessing of Allah be upon him) said, **"Was it at Allah (May Allah be pleased with him) and His Ayat (proofs,evidences, verses, lessons, signs, revelations, etc.) and His Messenger (May the peace andblessing of Allah be upon him) that you were mocking? Make no excuse; you have disbelieved after you had believed"**. (9:65,66) Neither he (May the peace and blessing of Allah be upon him) looked towards him nor spoke anything further.
