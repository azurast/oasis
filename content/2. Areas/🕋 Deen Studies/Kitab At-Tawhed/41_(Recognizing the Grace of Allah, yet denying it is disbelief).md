We are taught to be individuals who are conscious about the words they utter. Certain statements will have determintal effects in your tawheed & imaan.

Mujahid's statement

He is attributing his wealth to other than Allah. This is major shirk. Whoever believes the blessings he's enjoying is not from Allah alone, it gives the impression that Allah has an equal.

Verse

...

> Give them from what Allah has given you...

Some individuals says "oh we just say it but we don't mean it", yes because these statements will take you out of the fold of Islam. To say such statements without meaning it is considered as minor shirk.
