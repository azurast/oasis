Why the prophet kept his name (Ibn Abdul Muthalib) ?

1.  For lineage, so that the people know that he is of so and so's lineage when he call out to them
    
    _'I am a prophet no lie, I am the son of Abdul Muthalib'_
    
    Abdul Muthalib's real name is Shaybatul Hamad.
    
    How did 'Abdul Muthalib' came along?
    
    We know that the Prophet is from the lineage of Bani Hasyim. He said that Shayban was his slave due to his dirty appearance. Thus it is what it was known to the people and it stuck.
    
2.  smth about slavery ~ forgot
