If a person makes a request or seeks refuge or send an invitation or does kindness by Allah's name, we should respond it to our capability. But, if we are unable to do so, pray for the person until you feel like you have recompense him.

4 Cases :

1.  Something the person has a right over
    
    Ex : 'Fulan, I ask by Allah, give me back my money'
    
    Without the person mentioning the request, it was already an obligation to pay him back, but now that he mentions Allah's name it becomes much more serious.
    
2.  Something haram
    
    Ex: 'Fulan, I ask by Allah to give me that alcohol'
    
    In this case, we do not engage with haram things, and the sin is upon the one who asks.
    
3.  Something you own but if you were to give it to him, it will bring you harm and difficulty
    
    Ex: 'Fulan, I ask you by Allah to give me your house'
    
    No we don't have to, because it will be difficult for us if we were to give this thing to the person.
    
    "No harm and no reciprocating harm"
    
4.  Something you own and if you were to give it to him, it will not bring about harm nor difficulties for you
    
    Ex: 'Fulan, I ask you by Allah to leave this argument.'
    
    In this case you walk away.
    
    The majority of the scholars is that it is mustahab (recommended) and not wajib. So, you are not obliged to fulfill the request.
