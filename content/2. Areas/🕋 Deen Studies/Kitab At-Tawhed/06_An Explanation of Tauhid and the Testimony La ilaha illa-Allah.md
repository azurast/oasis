**Recall**

**QS Al-Isra (17:35)**

"Those whom they call upon (like Jesus- son of Mary, Ezra, angels, etc.) desire (for themselves) means of access to their Lord (Allah) as to which of them should be nearest and they (Jesus, Ezra, angels etc.) hope for His Mercy and fear His Torment. Verily; the Torment of Your Lord is something to be afraid of"

**QS Az-Zukhruf (43:26-28)**

And He said: "And (remember) when Abraham (May Allah be pleased with him) said to his father and his people: 'Verily, I am innocent of what you worship. Except Him (i.e. I worship none but Allah Alone), Who did create me and verily, He will guide me.' And he made it (i.e. La ilaha illa-Allah) a Word lasting among his offspring that they may turn back (i.e. to repent to Allah or receive admonition)."

**QS At-Tawbah (9:31)**

"They (Jews and Christians) took their rabbis and their monks to be their lords besides Allah."

**QS Al-Baqarah (2:165)**

"And of mankind are some who take (for worship) others besides Allah as rivals (to Allah). They love them as they love Allah but those who believe love Allah more (than anything else.)."

And in **Sahih (Muslim)** it is reported that the Prophet (May the peace and blessing of Allah be upon him) said: _"He who professed that there is no God to be worshipped but Allah and made a denial of everything which the people worship besides Allah, his property and blood become inviolable, and his affair rests with Allah."_

**Notes**

"You don't leave something out of taqwa, unless Allah will give you that which is better."

"There is no obedience to the creation if it means disobedience to the Creator."

-   These two verses is also a refutation
    
-   There was only Idol worship during that time. When the messenger was sent, he was sent to eradicate all types of shirk.
    
-   What happens is that these 'scholars' make their own rules & regulations following their own desires & benefit.
    
-   When people call upon the prophet, what is the difference between them and the Christians who put Jesus in between them & their lord.
    
-   If your love is the same way as you love Allah, then it is considered shirk.
    
-   How do I know if I'm falling into it?
    
    When you choose something over your duties to Allah.
    
    When you go against the command of Allah.
    
    In all these situations, you always have a CHOICE. Always choose Allah first, and make Allah your top priority.
    
-   When the adhan came, the first thing you hear is "Allahuakbar.. Allahuakbar", meaning "Allah is the greatest" and you are in a middle of a business. You should drop everything and answer upon the call of the prayer and pray straight away. Because Allah is Greater than anything else in the world, let alone the business you were doing.
    
-   If you continue to proceed, you are saying indirectly that the thing you are doing is greater than Allah.
