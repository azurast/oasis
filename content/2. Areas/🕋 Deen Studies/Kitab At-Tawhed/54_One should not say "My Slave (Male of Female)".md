Lord in the arabic language means _Rabb_

What does _Rabb_ means?

The arabs used to use this word in many context, for example _Rabbul Bait_ (the owner of the house). But now, it is not befitting to call them the _Rabb_ of a person (slave).

Usage of the word _Rabb_

1.  If the word is preceeded by Alif Lam, it can only be used for Allah. It's Muaraf. Ex: 'S_ubhana Rabiyal A’la Wabihamdihi_’
2.  Rabb as an owner of something. Ex: '_Rabb_ of this camel', Yes we can use this, it has been mentioned in a hadith when a companion asked prophet about a lost camel. Therefore, it is fine to use when we attribute it in reference to something without intellect.
3.  It is prohibited to use when we attribute it with someone with intellect (humans)
