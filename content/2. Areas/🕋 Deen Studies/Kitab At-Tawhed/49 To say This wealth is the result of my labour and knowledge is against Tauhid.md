The shaikh titled this chapter with an ayah

> Allah the Almighty said: "And truly, if We give him a taste of mercy from us, after some adversity (severe poverty or disease, etc.) has touched him, he is sure to say: 'This is for me (due to my merit), I think not that the Hour will be established. But if I am brought back to my Lord, surely, there will be for me the best (wealth, etc.) with Him'. Then, We verily, will show to the disbelievers what they have done and We shall make them taste a severe torment. " (41:50)

Allah talks about Qarun (from the people of Musa) and he was oppressive and he would pride himself over the wealth, knowledge and blessings that he received.

The scholars said there are 2 meanings regarding this

1.  "This wealth was given to me because of my merit and experience in earning."
2.  "Because of knowledge from Allah that I particularly deserved from Him."
