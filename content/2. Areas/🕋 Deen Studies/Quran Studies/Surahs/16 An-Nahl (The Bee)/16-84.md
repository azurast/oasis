# وَيَوۡمَ نَبۡعَثُ مِن كُلِّ أُمَّةٖ شَهِيدٗا ثُمَّ لَا يُؤۡذَنُ لِلَّذِينَ كَفَرُواْ وَلَا هُمۡ يُسۡتَعۡتَبُونَ

And [mention] the Day when We will resurrect from every nation a witness. Then it will not be permitted to the disbelievers [to apologize or make excuses], nor will they be asked to appease [Allah]
