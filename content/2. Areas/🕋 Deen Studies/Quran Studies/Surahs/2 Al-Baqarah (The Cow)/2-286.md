# لَا يُكَلِّفُ ٱللَّهُ نَفۡسًا إِلَّا وُسۡعَهَاۚ لَهَا مَا كَسَبَتۡ وَعَلَيۡهَا مَا ٱكۡتَسَبَتۡۗ رَبَّنَا لَا تُؤَاخِذۡنَآ إِن نَّسِينَآ أَوۡ أَخۡطَأۡنَاۚ رَبَّنَا وَلَا تَحۡمِلۡ عَلَيۡنَآ إِصۡرٗا كَمَا حَمَلۡتَهُۥ عَلَى ٱلَّذِينَ مِن قَبۡلِنَاۚ رَبَّنَا وَلَا تُحَمِّلۡنَا مَا لَا طَاقَةَ لَنَا بِهِۦۖ وَٱعۡفُ عَنَّا وَٱغۡفِرۡ لَنَا وَٱرۡحَمۡنَآۚ أَنتَ مَوۡلَىٰنَا فَٱنصُرۡنَا عَلَى ٱلۡقَوۡمِ ٱلۡكَٰفِرِينَ

Allah does not charge a soul except [with that within] its capacity. It will have [the consequence of] what [good] it has gained, and it will bear [the consequence of] what [evil] it has earned. =="Our Lord, do not impose blame upon us if we have forgotten or erred. Our Lord, and lay not upon us a burden like that which You laid upon those before us. Our Lord, and burden us not with that which we have no ability to bear. And pardon us; and forgive us; and have mercy upon us. You are our protector, so give us victory over the disbelieving people==

- Here Allah SWT tells us how to make dua to lighten the burden of the ayah that came before. 
- The dua is a fundamental principle in Islam, the matter of fact is that Allah does not ask you of you more than which you can bear. 
- Whatever good a person does will be accounted for you, and whatever evil a person does will be against you.
- Then Allah taught us the dua to lighten the burden for them.
- **Difference between forgetting vs making a mistake**. Forgetting is when the issue is completely out of the mind of the person, while a mistake is when the person intended something permissible but they fell into something wrong. 
- Some ulama says that Allah SWT has forgiven this ummah for the forgetfulness and the mistakes that we do, which was not the case for the previous ummah. Some nations, if they were forced to do something
 > - Previous nations, when they are upon gunpoint and asked to say they are not muslim, they were required to be patient and be killed for they would not be forgiven if they had said so
 > - Bani Israil was put into so much difficulty because they kept disobeying Allah and kept igonoring the messengers of Allah so Allah made things hard for them.
- Our religion lifts the burden that was put prior to the Ahlul Kitaab. So we can be certain that any ruling that exists in Islam for our benefit, whether you know/can see it or not.
- And we ask Allah to pardon & conceal the sins and its effects in this world and the hereafter.
- Asking Allah to have mercy upon us 
> [! Note]
> This reminds me of the Hadith of the person that says he wants to enter Jannah with his good deeds and apparently all his good deeds weren't even enough to repay Allah for the blessings of the eyes. And that the only way a person can enter Jannah is by the mercy of Allah alone. 
- The Prophet tells us that at the end of this ayah, Allah said *'I have certainly done what you asked me to do'* 
- Likewise at the end of Surah Al Fatihah [[1-7]] , what you ask for at the end of Surah Al Baqarah, Allah tells us that He will give it. 
> - One of the faidah of Al-Islam is that Allah has made it easy for us, especially when we compare it with previous nations. What they did wrongly was corrected & rectified.
> - Allah has said it that this religion is **not** a burden.
> - So when we see somone says certain parts of the religion is hard like wearing the hijab, waking up for Fajr, etc, there is no doubt that some of the things are not free of difficulty, but actually the more correct approach of saying/seeing it is there is nothing overly complex/burdensome/hardship upon you. 
> - But Allah has left this in His legislation 'difficulties' (like making wudhu in the morning with cold water) for a reason. So, be and feel confident when you are practicing your religion because you are doing it for a reason.
