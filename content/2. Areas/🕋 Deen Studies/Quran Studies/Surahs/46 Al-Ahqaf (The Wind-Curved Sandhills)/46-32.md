# وَمَن لَّا يُجِبۡ دَاعِيَ ٱللَّهِ فَلَيۡسَ بِمُعۡجِزٖ فِي ٱلۡأَرۡضِ وَلَيۡسَ لَهُۥ مِن دُونِهِۦٓ أَوۡلِيَآءُۚ أُوْلَـٰٓئِكَ فِي ضَلَٰلٖ مُّبِينٍ

But he who does not respond to the Caller of Allah will not cause failure [to Him] upon earth, and he will not have besides Him any protectors. Those are in manifest error
