# يُسَبِّحُ لِلَّهِ مَا فِي ٱلسَّمَٰوَٰتِ وَمَا فِي ٱلۡأَرۡضِۖ لَهُ ٱلۡمُلۡكُ وَلَهُ ٱلۡحَمۡدُۖ وَهُوَ عَلَىٰ كُلِّ شَيۡءٖ قَدِيرٌ

Whatever is in the heavens and whatever is on the earth is exalting Allah. To Him belongs dominion, and to Him belongs [all] praise, and He is over all things competent
