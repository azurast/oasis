# ٱلَّذِينَ ءَامَنُواْ وَهَاجَرُواْ وَجَٰهَدُواْ فِي سَبِيلِ ٱللَّهِ بِأَمۡوَٰلِهِمۡ وَأَنفُسِهِمۡ أَعۡظَمُ دَرَجَةً عِندَ ٱللَّهِۚ وَأُوْلَـٰٓئِكَ هُمُ ٱلۡفَآئِزُونَ

The ones who have believed, emigrated and striven in the cause of Allah with their wealth and their lives are greater in rank in the sight of Allah. And it is those who are the attainers [of success]
