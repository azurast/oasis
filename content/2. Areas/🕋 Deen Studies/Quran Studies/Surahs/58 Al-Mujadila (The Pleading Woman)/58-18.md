# يَوۡمَ يَبۡعَثُهُمُ ٱللَّهُ جَمِيعٗا فَيَحۡلِفُونَ لَهُۥ كَمَا يَحۡلِفُونَ لَكُمۡ وَيَحۡسَبُونَ أَنَّهُمۡ عَلَىٰ شَيۡءٍۚ أَلَآ إِنَّهُمۡ هُمُ ٱلۡكَٰذِبُونَ

On the Day Allah will resurrect them all, and they will swear to Him as they swear to you and think that they are [standing] on something. Unquestionably, it is they who are the liars
