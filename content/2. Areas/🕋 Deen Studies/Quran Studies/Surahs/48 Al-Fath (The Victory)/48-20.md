# وَعَدَكُمُ ٱللَّهُ مَغَانِمَ كَثِيرَةٗ تَأۡخُذُونَهَا فَعَجَّلَ لَكُمۡ هَٰذِهِۦ وَكَفَّ أَيۡدِيَ ٱلنَّاسِ عَنكُمۡ وَلِتَكُونَ ءَايَةٗ لِّلۡمُؤۡمِنِينَ وَيَهۡدِيَكُمۡ صِرَٰطٗا مُّسۡتَقِيمٗا

Allah has promised you much booty that you will take [in the future] and has hastened for you this [victory] and withheld the hands of people from you - that it may be a sign for the believers and [that] He may guide you to a straight path
