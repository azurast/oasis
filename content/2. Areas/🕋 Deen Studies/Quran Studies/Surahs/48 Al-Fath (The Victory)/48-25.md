# هُمُ ٱلَّذِينَ كَفَرُواْ وَصَدُّوكُمۡ عَنِ ٱلۡمَسۡجِدِ ٱلۡحَرَامِ وَٱلۡهَدۡيَ مَعۡكُوفًا أَن يَبۡلُغَ مَحِلَّهُۥۚ وَلَوۡلَا رِجَالٞ مُّؤۡمِنُونَ وَنِسَآءٞ مُّؤۡمِنَٰتٞ لَّمۡ تَعۡلَمُوهُمۡ أَن تَطَـُٔوهُمۡ فَتُصِيبَكُم مِّنۡهُم مَّعَرَّةُۢ بِغَيۡرِ عِلۡمٖۖ لِّيُدۡخِلَ ٱللَّهُ فِي رَحۡمَتِهِۦ مَن يَشَآءُۚ لَوۡ تَزَيَّلُواْ لَعَذَّبۡنَا ٱلَّذِينَ كَفَرُواْ مِنۡهُمۡ عَذَابًا أَلِيمًا

They are the ones who disbelieved and obstructed you from al-Masjid al-Haram while the offering was prevented from reaching its place of sacrifice. And if not for believing men and believing women whom you did not know - that you might trample them and there would befall you because of them dishonor without [your] knowledge - [you would have been permitted to enter Makkah]. [This was so] that Allah might admit to His mercy whom He willed. If they had been apart [from them], We would have punished those who disbelieved among them with painful punishment
