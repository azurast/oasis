# لَن تَنَالُواْ ٱلۡبِرَّ حَتَّىٰ تُنفِقُواْ مِمَّا تُحِبُّونَۚ وَمَا تُنفِقُواْ مِن شَيۡءٖ فَإِنَّ ٱللَّهَ بِهِۦ عَلِيمٞ

Never will you attain the good [reward] until you spend [in the way of Allah] from that which you love. And whatever you spend - indeed, Allah is Knowing of it

- The word ' ٱلۡبِرَّ' here has two possibilities:
	1. Generic word for everything that Allah loves and you will not be able to be righteous.
	2. Allah's reward meaning Jannah.
- You love wealth and possessions, and until you spend from that which you love you cannot attain this good from Allah.
- 'Whatever you spent' has 2 great benefits:
	1. It doesn't matter how small
	2. It does not have to be gold or silver it could be food, time, effort
