# قَدۡ كَانَ لَكُمۡ ءَايَةٞ فِي فِئَتَيۡنِ ٱلۡتَقَتَاۖ فِئَةٞ تُقَٰتِلُ فِي سَبِيلِ ٱللَّهِ وَأُخۡرَىٰ كَافِرَةٞ يَرَوۡنَهُم مِّثۡلَيۡهِمۡ رَأۡيَ ٱلۡعَيۡنِۚ وَٱللَّهُ يُؤَيِّدُ بِنَصۡرِهِۦ مَن يَشَآءُۚ إِنَّ فِي ذَٰلِكَ لَعِبۡرَةٗ لِّأُوْلِي ٱلۡأَبۡصَٰرِ

Already there has been for you a sign in the two armies which met - one fighting in the cause of Allah and another of disbelievers. They saw them [to be] twice their [own] number by [their] eyesight. But Allah supports with His victory whom He wills. Indeed in that is a lesson for those of vision

- The believers in Badr' saw the enemies to be twice bigger, when in fact it was three times bigger. So Allah is telling them that you have already seen what happened at Badr' and that Allah has given victory to the believers even when they are smaller in numbers.
