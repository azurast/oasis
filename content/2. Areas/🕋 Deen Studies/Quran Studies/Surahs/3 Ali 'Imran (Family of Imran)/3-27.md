# تُولِجُ ٱلَّيۡلَ فِي ٱلنَّهَارِ وَتُولِجُ ٱلنَّهَارَ فِي ٱلَّيۡلِۖ وَتُخۡرِجُ ٱلۡحَيَّ مِنَ ٱلۡمَيِّتِ وَتُخۡرِجُ ٱلۡمَيِّتَ مِنَ ٱلۡحَيِّۖ وَتَرۡزُقُ مَن تَشَآءُ بِغَيۡرِ حِسَابٖ

You cause the night to enter the day, and You cause the day to enter the night; and ==You bring the living out of the dead, and You bring the dead out of the living.== And You give provision to whom You will without account

There are two ways to understand the part of the verse regarding life & deaath:
1. Allah causes people to die and brings them back to life in yaumul qiyamah. And also, Allah causes people to come to life when he first gives them life and causes people to die.
2. Allah brings the believer out of their disbelieve. So he guides people to Islam. The same way Allah causes people to turn away from Islam, and to leave i (spritual death).
