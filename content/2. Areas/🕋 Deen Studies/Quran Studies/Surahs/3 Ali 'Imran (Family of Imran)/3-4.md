# مِن قَبۡلُ هُدٗى لِّلنَّاسِ وَأَنزَلَ ٱلۡفُرۡقَانَۗ إِنَّ ٱلَّذِينَ كَفَرُواْ بِـَٔايَٰتِ ٱللَّهِ لَهُمۡ عَذَابٞ شَدِيدٞۗ وَٱللَّهُ عَزِيزٞ ذُو ٱنتِقَامٍ

Before, as guidance for the people. And He revealed the Qur'an. Indeed, those who disbelieve in the verses of Allah will have a severe punishment, and Allah is exalted in Might, the Owner of Retribution

- **The Furqan** is that which distinguishes the truth from falsehood. 
- You are clearly told which is haq and batil.
- Therefore the Qur'an was sent down to distinguish what is right & wrong from the previous scriptures.
- ذُو ٱنتِقَامٍ is not a name of Allah, it is a sifaat/attribute of Allah.
- If Allah wants, he can take retribution/punishment against anyone, but He gives the people time to earn His forgiveness.
