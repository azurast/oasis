# يَوۡمَ تَجِدُ كُلُّ نَفۡسٖ مَّا عَمِلَتۡ مِنۡ خَيۡرٖ مُّحۡضَرٗا وَمَا عَمِلَتۡ مِن سُوٓءٖ تَوَدُّ لَوۡ أَنَّ بَيۡنَهَا وَبَيۡنَهُۥٓ أَمَدَۢا بَعِيدٗاۗ وَيُحَذِّرُكُمُ ٱللَّهُ نَفۡسَهُۥۗ وَٱللَّهُ رَءُوفُۢ بِٱلۡعِبَادِ

The Day every soul will find what it has done of good present [before it] and what it has done of evil, it will wish that between itself and that [evil] was a great distance. And Allah warns you of Himself, and Allah is Kind to [His] servants
