# إِلَّا ٱلَّذِينَ تَابُواْ مِنۢ بَعۡدِ ذَٰلِكَ وَأَصۡلَحُواْ فَإِنَّ ٱللَّهَ غَفُورٞ رَّحِيمٌ

Except for those who repent after that and correct themselves. For indeed, Allah is Forgiving and Merciful

- The context here is the people who turned away from islam after they have believed, and then they make tawbah. What they must do is make right and mend their ways and correct themselves to come back to the truth.
- This shows even the hypocrites can come back to the truth under the conditions of tawbah & mending their ways.
