# وَلَا يَأۡمُرَكُمۡ أَن تَتَّخِذُواْ ٱلۡمَلَـٰٓئِكَةَ وَٱلنَّبِيِّـۧنَ أَرۡبَابًاۚ أَيَأۡمُرُكُم بِٱلۡكُفۡرِ بَعۡدَ إِذۡ أَنتُم مُّسۡلِمُونَ

Nor could he order you to take the angels and prophets as lords. Would he order you to disbelief after you had been Muslims

- This is an evidence that some people used to pray to the angels and the prophets.
- They did not believe that the prophets created the heavens and the earth, but, they sought nearness to Allah by supplicating at the grave of those prophets.
- The prophet said:
	‘Ā’ishah (may Allah be pleased with her) reported that, during his terminal illness, the Messenger of Allah (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him) said: "May Allah curse the Jews and the Christians, they took the graves of their prophets as places of worship." She added: "Had it not been for that, his grave would have been made prominent, but it was feared that it might be taken as a place of worship."
