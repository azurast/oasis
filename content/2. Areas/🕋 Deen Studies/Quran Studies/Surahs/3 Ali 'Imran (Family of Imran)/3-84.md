# قُلۡ ءَامَنَّا بِٱللَّهِ وَمَآ أُنزِلَ عَلَيۡنَا وَمَآ أُنزِلَ عَلَىٰٓ إِبۡرَٰهِيمَ وَإِسۡمَٰعِيلَ وَإِسۡحَٰقَ وَيَعۡقُوبَ وَٱلۡأَسۡبَاطِ وَمَآ أُوتِيَ مُوسَىٰ وَعِيسَىٰ وَٱلنَّبِيُّونَ مِن رَّبِّهِمۡ لَا نُفَرِّقُ بَيۡنَ أَحَدٖ مِّنۡهُمۡ وَنَحۡنُ لَهُۥ مُسۡلِمُونَ

Say, "We have believed in Allah and in what was revealed to us and what was revealed to Abraham, Ishmael, Isaac, Jacob, and the Descendants, and in what was given to Moses and Jesus and to the prophets from their Lord. We make no distinction between any of them, and we are Muslims [submitting] to Him

- The muslims affirm that we believe in all the prophets and we make no distinction between them. This doesn't mean that some are not better than others as we know Allah has given virtues to some of the Messengers (the rasuls). What is meant by not making distinction here is we do not believe in some and disbelieve in others. So we have imaan with all of them.  
- Again this shows how the muslims differ from the jews and the christians who selectively believe in the prophets. The jews does not believe in Isa and Muhammad while the christians do not believe in Muhammad.
