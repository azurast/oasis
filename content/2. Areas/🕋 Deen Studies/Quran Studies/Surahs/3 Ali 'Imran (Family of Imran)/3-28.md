# لَّا يَتَّخِذِ ٱلۡمُؤۡمِنُونَ ٱلۡكَٰفِرِينَ أَوۡلِيَآءَ مِن دُونِ ٱلۡمُؤۡمِنِينَۖ وَمَن يَفۡعَلۡ ذَٰلِكَ فَلَيۡسَ مِنَ ٱللَّهِ فِي شَيۡءٍ إِلَّآ أَن تَتَّقُواْ مِنۡهُمۡ تُقَىٰةٗۗ وَيُحَذِّرُكُمُ ٱللَّهُ نَفۡسَهُۥۗ وَإِلَى ٱللَّهِ ٱلۡمَصِيرُ

==Let not believers take disbelievers as allies rather than believers==. And whoever [of you] does that has nothing with Allah, except when taking precaution against them in prudence. And Allah warns you of Himself, and to Allah is the [final] destination

- A command to take disbelivers as awliyaa'.
- No doubt we can have acquaintances with them, but they should not be your closest supporters. You should not think that you and them are on the same team. You do not have a shared goal. Except, that we treat them with kindness so that they may be lead to Islam.
- A country may make a pact with another country, for maslahat (general benefit), but not in regards of the religion.

> From the fundamental of this religion is **Al Wala' wa Al-Bara'**
> Allegiance is to Allah & His Messengers, and the believers. And we dissasociate with the disbelievers. Except perhaps when they threathen you & you feel like they may harm you.
