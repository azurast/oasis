# نَزَّلَ عَلَيۡكَ ٱلۡكِتَٰبَ بِٱلۡحَقِّ مُصَدِّقٗا لِّمَا بَيۡنَ يَدَيۡهِ وَأَنزَلَ ٱلتَّوۡرَىٰةَ وَٱلۡإِنجِيلَ

He has sent down upon you, [O Muhammad], the Book ==in truth, confirming what was before it.== And He revealed the Torah and the Gospel

- It confirms in 2 aspects:
	1. **مُصَدِّقٗا: The Qur'an is what we judge the previous scriptures by.**
		- What is affirmed by the Qur'an and As-Sunnah, we believe it.
		- What is rejected we do not believe in.
		- What it is silent about, we are also silent about: ![[17-36]]
	2. **Ahlul Kitaab themselves can see the truth of Islam through the Qur'an.** (that it is consistent with their scriptures)
		- What we see from both kitaabs today, we don't see much of the speech of Allah. 
		- What we meant by the real Injiil and Taurat, are the speech (kalaam) of Allah to Isa & Musa Alaihissalatuwassalam. Not the ones being written by John/Martin/Mark etc.
