# وَٱلَّذِينَ كَسَبُواْ ٱلسَّيِّـَٔاتِ جَزَآءُ سَيِّئَةِۭ بِمِثۡلِهَا وَتَرۡهَقُهُمۡ ذِلَّةٞۖ مَّا لَهُم مِّنَ ٱللَّهِ مِنۡ عَاصِمٖۖ كَأَنَّمَآ أُغۡشِيَتۡ وُجُوهُهُمۡ قِطَعٗا مِّنَ ٱلَّيۡلِ مُظۡلِمًاۚ أُوْلَـٰٓئِكَ أَصۡحَٰبُ ٱلنَّارِۖ هُمۡ فِيهَا خَٰلِدُونَ

But they who have earned [blame for] evil doings - the recompense of an evil deed is its equivalent, and humiliation will cover them. They will have from Allah no protector. It will be as if their faces are covered with pieces of the night - so dark [are they]. Those are the companions of the Fire; they will abide therein eternally
