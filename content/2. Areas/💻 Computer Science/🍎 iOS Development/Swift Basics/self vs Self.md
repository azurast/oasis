In Swift, `self` and `Self` have different meanings and contexts:

1. `self`: `self` refers to the instance of the current type within an instance method, computed property, or initializer. It is used to access properties, methods, and other members of the instance. You typically use `self` to distinguish between instance properties and method parameters that have the same name. For example:

```swift
class MyClass {
    var value: Int

    init(value: Int) {
        self.value = value
    }

    func printValue() {
        print(self.value) // Accessing the instance property using self
    }
}
```

In the example above, `self.value` refers to the instance property `value` of the current object.

2. `Self`: `Self` (with a capital "S") is used to refer to the type of the current class or struct within the definition of that type. It is used when you need to refer to the type itself rather than a specific instance of the type. For example:

```swift
class ParentClass {
    func createInstance() -> Self {
        return type(of: self).init()
    }
}

class ChildClass: ParentClass {
    var value: Int = 10

    required init() {}

    func printValue() {
        print(self.value)
    }
}
```

In this example, `Self` is used in the `createInstance()` method of the `ParentClass` to return an instance of the same type as the class that calls it. This allows subclasses to create instances of their own type.

To summarize, `self` refers to the current instance of a type, while `Self` refers to the type itself within the type's definition.
