In SwiftUI, both `@StateObject` and `@ObservedObject` are used to provide a data-driven connection between an instance of a class conforming to the `ObservableObject` protocol and the view. The key difference lies in **ownership and lifecycle**. 

`@StateObject` is used when **the view owns the object and is responsible for its creation and lifecycle**, ensuring that a new object isn't created every time the view redraws. 

On the other hand, `@ObservedObject` is used **when the object is passed into the view**, usually from a parent view, and **the view does not own the object or control its lifecycle**, meaning it could potentially be recreated if the parent view is redrawn.
