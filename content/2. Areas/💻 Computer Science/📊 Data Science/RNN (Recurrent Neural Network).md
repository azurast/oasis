Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) utilize a unique architecture that includes a recurrent loop in their hidden layers, enabling them to remember information from previous states. This recurrent loop is the key feature that differentiates RNNs from other neural network types and allows them to process sequential data effectively. Here's how it works:

1. **Sequential Data Processing**: In an RNN, data is processed sequentially. For a given sequence (like a sentence or a time series), each element (like a word or a time point) is fed into the network one by one.

2. **Hidden State Maintenance**: At each step in the sequence, the RNN maintains a hidden state, which is a vector representing the information retained at that point. This hidden state is crucial as it acts as the network's memory.

3. **Recurrent Loop Mechanism**:
    - **Initial State**: The hidden state is initialized, often with zeros, at the start of processing a sequence.
    - **Update with Input and Previous State**: For each element in the sequence, the RNN combines the current input with the previous hidden state to calculate the new hidden state. This is typically done using a weighted sum of the input and the previous state, passed through an activation function like tanh or ReLU.
    - **Weights and Activation**: The network has trainable weights that determine how much of the new input and how much of the previous state should be considered in the new state. The activation function helps to introduce non-linearity and control the range of the hidden state values.

4. **Output Generation**: The current hidden state can be used to generate an output at each step. For instance, in language modeling, it might predict the next word in a sequence.

5. **Passing the State Along**: Crucially, after processing each element of the sequence, the hidden state is looped back into the network as the 'previous state' for the next step. This looping mechanism is the 'recurrent loop' that allows the RNN to remember information from earlier in the sequence.

6. **End of Sequence**: When the sequence ends, the final state can be used as a representation of the entire sequence.

This process allows RNNs to take into account not just the current input but also the context provided by what has already been processed. Thus, they are well-suited for tasks where the order and context of data points are important, such as speech recognition, language translation, and time-series analysis. However, standard RNNs can struggle with long sequences due to issues like vanishing gradients, where the influence of inputs diminishes over time.
